# Hi Folks üëã  

## üéì About Me  
I‚Äôm **Uday Sapra**, a Senior at **New York University**, pursuing a dual major in **Finance** from the Stern School of Business and **Data Science** from the Center for Data Science. My professional niche surfaces in being a business-oriented data scientist ‚Äî yielded by my ability to harmonize my academic background in both data and business. 


## üí° What I Do  
I thrive at the intersection of **business** and **technology**. Data and ML serve as the lenses through which I structure business problems, brainstorm, and build tangible solutions. My experience at a business school yields me the ability to effectively communicate my quantitative research, insights, and development to overaching business leaders - ironing out the communication gap between data-scientists and decision-makers. Effectively, I have been able to foster a trail of tangible business impact through my work. 


## üåü Notable Experiences  

### **Data Science Intern, CVS Health**  
*Time Series Forecasting with Transformers*  
- Enhanced **nationwide demand forecasting models** for 200,000+ products using transformer-based models.  
- Achieved a **98% reduction in training time** and a **50% loss reduction** by prototyping efficient autoregressive transformers and fine-tuning seasonal category models with custom loss functions.  
- Published internal reports recognized by senior leadership and presented findings to the **Consumer Analytics AVP**.  

### **Research Data Scientist, NYU Redlining Lab**  
*Document Entity Extraction with cRNNs and LLMs*  
- Digitized **280,000 mortgage document scans (1930‚Äì1970)** into a publicly available dataset, estimated to save NYU **$300,000** by eliminating manual digitization.  
- Leveraged **docTR** (open-source OCR) and prompt-engineered **Llama**, **Mistral**, and **NVIDIA LLMs** for entity extraction.  
- Designed a robust pipeline ensuring high accuracy and usability of extracted data.  

### **Data Science Intern, BusinessNext**  
*Querying Databases with LLMs*  
- Built and tested a product enabling clients to query SQL databases using **natural language**.  
- Analyzed CRM databases to generate insights and ideate product innovations aligned with client demand.  


## üíª What Drives Me  
I‚Äôm passionate about **cutting-edge yet interpretable and explaineable data science** - my work involves experimenting with the latest models and breakthroughs while ensuring they're communicated effectively to diverse stakeholders. I believe a deep understanding of quantitative models and the ability to analyze, communicate, and present the resulting insights is the most effective way to steer business and create value as a data-scientist. **Therefore, with all my recent projects, you'll either find a summary report or slideck that distills the entire development process and analysis :)**


## üåè Beyond Work  
- Co-founded **NYU Blockchain and Fintech**, growing it to **100+ members** and fostering professional partnerships.  
- Founded **Saahayak**, a student-led initiative supporting NGOs and addressing social challenges, impacting **10,000+ individuals** over three years.
- Passionate about photography, biking, writing, motorsports, cricket, geopolitics, watches, perfumes
