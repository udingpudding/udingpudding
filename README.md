## Hi Folksüëã

üéì **About Me**  
I‚Äôm Uday, a Senior at **New York University**, pursuing a dual major in **Finance** from the Stern School of Business and **Data Science** from the Center for Data Science. My professional niche is being a business-oriented data scientist - enabled by my ability to merge my business acumen with quantitative, data and modelling skills. 

üí° **What I Do**  
Congruent to my education, I professionally thrive at the intersection of business and technology, utilizing data-science as a decision-making tool to steer business. My journey in data science stems from a strong desire to structurally solve complex problems and translate technical solutions into tangible business value.  

üåü **Notable Experiences**  
- **Data Science Intern, CVS Health** || Time Series Forecasting with Transformers 
  - Enhanced nationwide demand forecasting models for 200,000+ products using transformer-based models.  
  - Achieved a **98% reduction in training time** and a **50% loss reduction** by prototyping efficient autoregressive transformers and fine-tuning seasonal category models with custom loss functions.  
  - Published internal reports recognized by senior leadership and presented findings to the Consumer Analytics AVP.  

- ** Research Data Scientist, NYU Redlining Project**  || Document Entity Extraction with cRNNs and LLMs 
  - Digitized **280,000 mortgage document scans (1930‚Äì1970)** into a publicly available dataset using a custom computer vision and GenAI-based pipeline, estimated to save NYU **$300,000** by eliminating manual digitization.  
  - Leveraged **docTR** (open-source OCR) and prompt-engineered **Llama**, **Mistral**, and **NVIDIA LLMs** for entity extraction.  
  - Created an efficient pipeline to ensure high accuracy and usability of extracted data.  

- **Data Science Intern, BusinessNext** || Querying Databases with LLMs
  - Built and tested a product leveraging LLMs to enable clients to query SQL databases in natural language.  
  - Analyzed CRM databases to generate insights and ideate innovations aligned with client demand.  

üíª **What Drives Me**  
I‚Äôm deeply passionate about **interpretable data science**, ensuring that complex models and solutions can be effectively communicated and utilized by diverse stakeholders. I bring this focus of eliminating the communication gap between data scientists and overarching business to every project - bridging technical expertise with business strategy to translate solutions into tangible impact.
